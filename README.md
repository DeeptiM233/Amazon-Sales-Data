# Amazon-Sales-Data
Task 2 this is my second task. i have analysed a basic dataset of amazon to see the rating of the whole dataset defining its minimum and maximum also the average of it. i also analysed the discount price of each category and actual price of it. a line chart tracks the sum of ratings and discounted prices by category, a pie chart illustrates the count of categories by rating, and a bar chart shows discount percentages across categories. This integrated view is ideal for quick, data-driven insights into product performance and pricing dynamics.
